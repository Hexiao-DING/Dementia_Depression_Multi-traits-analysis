# Dementia_Depression_Multi-traits-analysis
This is a comperhensive R code for MTAG analysis in Dementia_Depression comorbidity. The repository collects the scripts used to process GWAS summary statistics, perform MTAG meta-analysis, annotate loci with FUMA, and execute HyPrColoc-based colocalisation against eQTL resources. The code base was organised for GitHub distribution with consistent English documentation and a clear separation between R, Python, and helper documentation assets.

## Repository Layout

- `R/` – R scripts for GWAS quality control, liftover, colocalisation, and post-processing.
- `python/` – Python utilities for FUMA table extraction, multi-trait merges, and MTAG/eQTL integrations.
- `docs/` – Step-by-step setup notes (e.g., MTAG installation, SMR replication instructions).
- `figs/` – Reserved for figures or plots generated by the analytical workflow (currently empty).
- `Others(delete)/` – Workspace scratch area retained from the original project (remove if not required).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or copy the repository** into your analysis environment.
2. **Review data paths**: most scripts reference absolute Windows paths under `D:/Projects_data&code/Stage1_bioinformatics_ADandDepression`. Update these to match your local directory layout before execution.
3. **Install dependencies**:
   - R packages: `data.table`, `dplyr`, `MungeSumstats`, `rtracklayer`, `SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP144.GRCh37`, `hyprcoloc`, and others noted at the top of each script.
   - Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, and any additional libraries referenced within the scripts.
4. **Review the documentation** in `docs/` for environment-specific setup (MTAG on Linux, SMR replication steps, etc.).

## Usage Notes

- The scripts assume that raw GWAS and eQTL inputs have already been downloaded to the `Data/` and `Files/` directories referenced in the code. Adjust the base paths if you store inputs elsewhere.
- Many workflows write intermediate and final outputs under `Files/` (for example, `FUMA_results`, `Coloc_results`, or `MTAG_results`). Ensure these directories exist or create them before running the scripts.
- When sharing the repository, avoid committing large intermediate datasets; focus on scripts and lightweight configuration files.
